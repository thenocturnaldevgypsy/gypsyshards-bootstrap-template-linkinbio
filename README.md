## GypsyShards : free and open source templates of Link in Bio created using Bootstrap 5.3.3 

> [!NOTE]
> `GypsyShards` is one of my active personal project for refreshing my skills with the latest Bootstrap's release (5.3.3), focusing with creating Responsive (`mobile`, `tablet` and `desktop`) Link in Bio templates. If you want to ask some questions and provide feedback, feel free to start a discussion or an issue, I'll try my best to answer.
